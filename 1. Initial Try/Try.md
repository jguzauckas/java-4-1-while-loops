# Initial Try

In `Try.java`, there are two `if` statements that just need their boolean expressions. Can you fill in a boolean expression that will make sense for their respective `print` statements

When you are done, the following output should be produced by the file:

```
x is between 5 and 15
x is not equal to 5 or 15
```

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
