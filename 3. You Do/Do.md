# You Do

Your parent sends you to the store with some money to potentially buy a new TV. They give you some stipulations though:
- You can buy the TV outright if it is under $500.
- You can buy the TV if it is 4K if it is under $750.
- You can buy the TV if it is 4K and on sale if it is under $1000 (before the sale).

Make a String variable called `resolution` and set it initially to `"1080p"`.

Make a boolean variable called `isOnSale` and set it initially to `false`.

Make an integer variable called `price` and set it initially to `800`.

Use `if` blocks to determine if someone can buy a TV based on the requirements listed above. We should be able to modify the values of any of the variables above to potentially change the output, so you have to program all the options.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
