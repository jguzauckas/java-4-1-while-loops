# Basics Check

Create an integer variable named `age` and store your age in it.

Create a boolean variable named `isStudent` and store your status as student in it.

We want to create an `if` block that will selectively print out the following statements using compound boolean expressions and/or nested `if` statements:

```
You are an adult that is not a student.
You are a college student.
You are a high school student.
You are a middle school student.
You are an elementary school student.
You are a young child that is not a student.
```

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
